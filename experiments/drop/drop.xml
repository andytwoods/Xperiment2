Colour Shape Matching – The Role of Emotion, Mental Imagery, and Creativity
Dear participant,
Welcome to this experiment exploring colours and shapes from the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford. In this experiment you will be asked to match colours and shapes, rate them, and answer some questions about yourself and some items. To find out more about what to expect download the official participant sheet here (LINK TO PDF - TO BE DONE).
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the researcher under noemi.dreksler@psy.ox.ac.uk.
Before you begin please make sure:
 -  You have normal or corrected-to-normal vision
 -  You are not colour blind or colour impaired in any way (e.g. red/green colour blindness, which is common in men)
 -  You are sitting in a room lit normally (not dark) that is quiet and free from distractions.
Thank you for your help with our research!"

"In this task you will be presented with an item (e.g. a brick) and what it is usually used for (e.g. used for building). You will then be asked to write down six different ways one could use this item that you can think of (e.g. as a doorstop, for building a house, to throw through a window, as a toy coffin at a Barbie funeral, a diving aid, a paperweight). 
 
The uses you think of should aim to be as uncommon, original, and creative as possible. After 3 minutes you will be taken to the next task – but please try and not feel rushed and instead focus on writing down uncommon uses.

Press ‘I’m ready’ below to be taken to the task."

Thank-you for completing our study!     
The aim of this research was to investigate how spatial location would facilitate visual search for product packaging that was associated with a specific taste label. Previous research has demonstrated the existence of a number of crossmodal correspondences between taste/flavour and visual attributes. Here, we want to assess the correspondence between a taste and spatial elevation (up and down) and/or laterality (left and right).     
      If you have any further questions, please contact Olivia Petit (Email: oliviapetit@imagineeringinstitute.org).         
PLEASE REMEMBER TO VISIT THE BELOW LINK SO PROLFIC ACADEMIC KNOWS YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE STUDY. THANKS.
