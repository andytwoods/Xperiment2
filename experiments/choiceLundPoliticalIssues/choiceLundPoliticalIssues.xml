DESCRIPTION
           
This study investigates people’s views on the most relevant political issues of the US election 2016. Lund University has no political affiliation and the researchers have no political agenda.

PROCEDURES 
           
We are looking for participants over the age of 18. The experiment takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. You will be paid £1.5 for your participation.
    	 
During the experiment you will be asked to fill in two questionnaires concerning your views on political policies like “the federal minimum wage should  be raised”. In the end, there will be some brief questions about your views on the current campaign, and a chance to provide feedback to the researchers about the study.


Please note that your participation is completely voluntary. You may withdraw for any reason at any point during the experiment. However, we are only able to reimburse participants who complete the full experiment. All data will be aggregated and anonymized, and in no way will any individual person be identifiable from the results. The data will be stored in a password-protected computer and may be used in academic publications and written up as part of a doctoral thesis.

		  "Your task in the following survey is to decide to what extent you agree with different political policies, such as: ”The federal government should subsidize US industry to keep jobs in the country” or “The federal minimum wage should be raised”.


You will be asked to evaluate 12 such statements, and you will give your answer on a continuous scale from “absolutely disagree” to “absolutely agree”.


The survey is meant to function equally well with traditional computer input, as well as stylus or finger input on a touch screen. Therefore, you will be required to draw an X on the scale to mark your answer. 


Below is a test example. If you absolutely agree or disagree with the policy, then you should draw your X towards the end-points of the scale. If you have some doubts about the policy, then position your X somewhat closer to the center. If you are open minded about the issue, then position your X close to the center. If you are not satisfied with your first answer, you can redraw your X at a new position. You can draw your X in any size or form. It does not have to be positioned perfectly across the line."  />

		<.text>THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATING IN OUR STUDY.
		
In this study we are interested the political policies proposed by the two presidential candidates in the current US election, and to what extent people might be open-minded about these issues during an extremely polarizing election campaign, and in an extremely polarized media climate.
     	 
To investigate this, for some individuals the survey you just completed contained as special twist, where some of the answers you originally gave were moved into the center of the scale before you reviewed them again. Thus, changing your position from being in favor of one of the policies to being neutral between them.
     	 
Here, to the left, you can see an image of the survey you answered before. The green crosses show your original answers. The yellow dots show where your answers were moved by us (if you were among the people whose scores were moved), and the black crosses show the final position of your own cross after you went through all the questions and considered them again.


We have found in previous studies that alterations of the kind we showed you above often go unnoticed, in all kinds of decision tasks, such as consumer choice and attractiveness judgements.---This phenomenon, which we call “choice blindness” is not something particular to you. As far as we know, it is not related to working memory or attentional capacity, or any personality traits, or any socioeconomic variables, like age, sex, education or income. More likely, it is a basic feature of the human cognitive system that not all decisions and opinions are as specific and ingrained as most people think.
     	 
The purpose of this study was not to change your mind in any particular political direction (indeed, all the changes were made randomly between your answers), but to see whether people in general might be more flexible and open minded than suggested by the current polarized campaign and media climate. When you described yourself as (more or less) open minded after the summary score, this was not a reflection of what you first answered, but it was certainly a reflection of what you could have answered if the original survey had encouraged you to think about the pros and cons of the different positions, and allowed you to discuss this complexity.
