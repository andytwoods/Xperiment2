“TO SEE OR NOT TO SEE”: THE EFFICACY OF TRANSPARENT WINDOWS IN PACKAGING
Dear participant,
Welcome to our study! We are the Crossmodal Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University.    
We are interested in understanding how people associate information across the senses. If you decide to take part in this experiment, you will be asked to look at some different types of food and drink packaging and will be asked some questions about your opinions of them.
There are no right or wrong responses, so please respond according to what feels right to you. We hope you enjoy it. Your participation is very important to us.    
You are being invited to participate because you are a member of the Prolific Academic online participant panel. The questionnaire will take around 10 minutes to complete.   
You would still be free to withdraw from the study at any time during the questionnaire, without needing to give a reason, and without penalty. The data will be fully anonymized, and stored on a secure computer at the Crossmodal Research Laboratory, University of Oxford. The data will only be accessible by members of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory, and will be destroyed on 30th September 2016. Prolific Academic staff will not be able to access your responses. This research has been reviewed by and received favourable opinion through the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee."

	<.text>“To see or not to see”: The efficacy of transparent windows in packaging    
Thank-you for completing our study!     
The aim of this research was to investigate how the salience of certain visual elements of packaging influence perceptions of the product within.      
Previous research has suggested that being able to see a food product through its packaging (that is, through a transparent window) increases the visual salience of the food product inside. This, in turn, leads to increased consumption of the product, compared to when the product cannot be seen through the packaging. Our research intends to investigate whether imagery of the product on the packaging produces a similar effect, and if so, whether the size of this effect is greater or lesser than for transparent windows on packaging.     
The results of this study will not include your name or any other information that could be used to identify you. This research did not use deception. If you have any further questions, please contact Gregory Simmonds (Email: gregory.simmonds@psy.ox.ac.uk).      
If you have a concern about any aspect of this project, please contact the chair of the Medical Sciences Inter-divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (Chair, MS IDREC; Email: ethics@medsci.ox.ac.uk; Address: Research Services, University of Oxford, Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JD). The chair will seek to resolve the matter in a reasonably expeditious manner.
