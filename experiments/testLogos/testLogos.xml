Welcome to our study! We are a company called Flying Fish Research, which performs online research (such as this study) for both companies and scientists.
We are deciding what logo we should use for our company and thought to ask Prolific Academic participants for their opinion. We will ask you questions about several logo and font designs we are deciding between.
Your participation is very important to us."
