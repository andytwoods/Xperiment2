	<.text>“To see or not to see”: The efficacy of transparent windows in packaging
Thank-you for completing our study!
The aim of this research was to investigate how the salience of certain visual elements of packaging influence perceptions of the product within.
Previous research has suggested that being able to see a food product through its packaging (that is, through a transparent window) increases the visual salience of the food product inside. This, in turn, leads to increased consumption of the product, compared to when the product cannot be seen through the packaging. Our research intends to investigate whether imagery of the product on the packaging produces a similar effect, and if so, whether the size of this effect is greater or lesser than for transparent windows on packaging.
The results of this study will not include your name or any other information that could be used to identify you. This research did not use deception. If you have any further questions, please contact Gregory Simmonds (Email: gregory.simmonds@psy.ox.ac.uk).
If you have a concern about any aspect of this project, please contact the chair of the Medical Sciences Inter-divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (Chair, MS IDREC; Email: ethics@medsci.ox.ac.uk; Address: Research Services, University of Oxford, Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JD). The chair will seek to resolve the matter in a reasonably expeditious manner.
