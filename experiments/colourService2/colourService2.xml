Trust online
Dear participant,
Welcome to our study! We are the Imagineering Institute, based in Iskandar, Malaysia.    
We are interested in understanding how people trust information across the senses. If you decide to take part in this experiment, you will be presented with different colours, one at a time, which may be used in the corporate image of a bank. We would like you to categorize the colours in terms whether you would trust a bank that uses the colour in its corporate image.
There are no right or wrong responses, so please respond according to what feels right to you. We hope you enjoy it. Your participation is very important to us.    
You are being invited to participate because you are a member of the Prolific Academic online participant panel. The study will take around 5 minutes to complete.   
You would still be free to withdraw from the study at any time during the questionnaire, without needing to give a reason, and without penalty. The data will be fully anonymized, and stored on a secure computer at the Imagineering Institute."

Thank-you for completing our study!     
The aim of this research was to investigate how colours influence trust online. Previous research has suggested that certain colours facilitate turst more than others. In that sense, we want to study which colours may be more trustable when it comes to the context of financial services.    
      If you have any further questions, please contact Carlos Velasco (Email: carlos@imagineeringinstitute.org).
