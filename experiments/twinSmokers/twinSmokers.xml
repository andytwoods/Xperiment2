	<.text>Despite a general decline in smoking in the developed world, the prevalence of smoking in young people remains a concern.  It is widely acknowledged that smoking can accelerate the appearance of facial aging, and young people are sensitive to the potential negative effects of this accelerated aging on their attractiveness. Given this, one possibility for a smoking prevention/cessation intervention targeting young people is an application illustrating the changes in facial appearance likely if they age as a smoker, compared with the changes likely if they age as a non-smoker.
Researchers at Roswell Park Cancer Institute have previously developed an application of this kind. From large groups of smokers and non-smokers they developed transformations that could be applied to the face of a young person to demonstrate how they would age as a smoker and a non-smoker. In a recent randomised control trial of young female adult smokers, the use of the application in addition to the usual smoking cessation support gave reductions in quit smoking attitudes, nicotine dependence and self- reports of smoking compared to use of the usual cessation support alone.
One potential issue with this approach is that genetic factors also play a large role in the rate of facial aging. This means that if the two groups on which the transformations are based (smokers and non-smokers) are drawn from a population without controlling for other individual differences, it is possible that these individual differences, and not just differences in smoking behaviour, could have caused any differences in facial appearance between the two groups. To address this, one approach would be to have two groups that are matched genetically, but vary in terms of smoking behaviour. 
A recent initiative by Case Western Reserve University provides an opportunity for exactly this. Researchers captured the photographs of faces of sets of identical twins in which one twin smoked and the other did not smoke, or had smoked for at least 5 years less. Theoretically, these stimuli will enable us to produce an intervention similar to that developed at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, but crucially, one that has control for genetic variations in aging of facial appearance. 
An initial exploration of the differences in facial appearance between the smoking and non-smoking twins, revealed greater signs of certain age-related facial features (e.g. bags under eyes and wrinkles around lips) in the smoking twins. However, a smoking cessation intervention of the kind discussed here will only work if these differences alter the attractiveness of faces, so that faces aged as non-smokers appear more attractive than faces aged as smokers. 
The study you have just completed will provide us with data that will help us establish if the smoking and no-smoking twins are suitable for use in this kind of intervention.
