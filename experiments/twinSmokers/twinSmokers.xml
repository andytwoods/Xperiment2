	<.text>Despite a general decline in smoking in the developed world, the prevalence of smoking in young people remains a concern.  It is widely acknowledged that smoking can accelerate the appearance of facial aging, and young people are sensitive to the potential negative effects of this accelerated aging on their attractiveness. Given this, one possibility for a smoking prevention/cessation intervention targeting young people is an application illustrating the changes in facial appearance likely if they age as a smoker, compared with the changes likely if they age as a non-smoker.

The study you have just completed will provide us with data that will help us decide which kind are faces are suitable for use in the development of this kind of intervention.
