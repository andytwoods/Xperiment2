Colour Shape Matching – The Role of Emotion, Mental Imagery, and Creativity
Dear participant,
Welcome to this experiment exploring colours and shapes from the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford. In this experiment you will be asked to match colours and shapes, rate them, and answer some questions about yourself and some items. To find out more about what to expect download the official participant sheet here (LINK TO PDF - TO BE DONE).
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the researcher under noemi.dreksler@psy.ox.ac.uk.
Before you begin please make sure:
 -  You have normal or corrected-to-normal vision
 -  You are not colour blind or colour impaired in any way (e.g. red/green colour blindness, which is common in men)
 -  You are sitting in a room lit normally (not dark) that is quiet and free from distractions.
Thank you for your help with our research!"
