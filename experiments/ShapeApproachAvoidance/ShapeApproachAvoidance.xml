Dear participant,
Welcome to our study! We are the Crossmodal Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University.    
We are interested in understanding how people evaluate different objects. If you decide to take part in this experiment, you will be asked to rate different objects with specific word descriptors.
There are no right or wrong responses, so please respond according to what feels right to you. We hope you enjoy it. Your participation is very important to us.    
You are being invited to participate because you are a member of the Prolific Academic online participant panel. The questionnaire will take around 10 minutes to complete.   
You would still be free to withdraw from the study at any time during the questionnaire, without needing to give a reason, and without penalty. The data will be fully anonymized, and stored on a secure computer at the Crossmodal Research Laboratory, University of Oxford. The data will only be accessible by members of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory. Prolific Academic staff will not be able to access your responses. This research has been reviewed by and received favourable opinion through the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee."

Thank-you for completing our study!     
The aim of this research was to investigate whether object valence (positive or negative) and contour (angular vs. round) and/or symmetry (symmetrical vs. asymmetrical) influence peoples associations of the objects with approach and avoidance words. Previous research seems to suggest that round and symmetrical objects ten to be associated with approach words whereas angular and assymetrical objects tend to be associated with avoidance words instead. Here, we also manipulated the valence of the object, that is, whether the object is associated with positive (a cake) or negative emotions (a knife).
